## Overview

**Project Title**: Star Wars Translator

**Project Description**: A simple "translator" from english to various star wars writing systems.

**Project Goals**: Create a real-time translation for a chosen language. Make it look kinda coolish too if I can.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. I don't know much about Kotlin's dependancies, but it SHOULD just run on another system as an APK.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Download the app to your phone or a viritual phone.
2. After opening it, click start.
3. Choose the language you want at the top.
4. Type in any text you want to translate.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* The only thing you should need is an APK of the app, it should run just with that.
